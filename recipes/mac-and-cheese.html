                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Spray the inside of a 1 1/2-quart casserole dish <br>
                with non-stick cooking spray. Combine Cheddar and Colby Jack cheeses <br>
                in a medium bowl and set aside.

                Cook macaroni in boiling salted water according to package directions; <br>
                drain well and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, melt butter in a medium saucepan over low heat.<br>
                Blend in flour, stirring constantly, until smooth and bubbly.<br>
                Gradually whisk in milk and half & half. Stir constantly, <br>
                until mixture boils and thickens (about 2 to 3 minutes).<br>
                Remove from heat and add cayenne and black peppers, <br>
                and 2 cups of the reserved cheese mixture; stir until cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.

                Stir cooked macaroni into the sauce and season to taste.<br>

                remaining 1/2 cup of cheese and dot with additional butter, if desired.<br>
